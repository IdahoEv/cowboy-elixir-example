  Start up a cowboy http server.  The start_http method of cowboy takes
  four arguments:
    * The protocol of the server
    * "NbAcceptors" - a non-negative-integer. This isn't further documented in
      the cowboy docs.  I used 100, from an Erlang example.
    * TCP options for Ranch as a list of tuples.  In this case the one one
      we are using is :port, to set the server listening on port 8080.
      You could also, for example, set ipv6, timeouts, and a number of other things here.
      SEE ALSO: http://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.2/manual/ranch_tcp/
    * Protocol options for cowboy as a list of tuples.  This can be a very big
      structure because it includes you "middleware environment", which among
      other things includes your entire routing table. Here that is the only option
      we are specifying.

  The dispatch configuration specifies your routing table: how incoming
  URLs are mapped to the Module and function that should get run for that
  request.  It's built with the `:cowboy_router.compile` function, which
  takes a list of tuples.  Each tuple specifies a hostname (or wildcard)
  that can match, and the options -- including routes -- for that hostname.

  Each route is a tuple of the form `{ PathMatch, Handler, Options}`.

  Individual components of the configuration are documented in comments
  line-by-line in the code below.
